# mailship
Currently this is more or less an experiment to set up a complete postfix/dovecot based mailserver in a single docker container. I want to keep it as simple as possible.

### Usecase
* Hosting your own webpage and info@your-domain.com style e-mail adresses but you do not need a full e-mail server.
* Have this server behind a reverse proxy that handles all the TLS stuff.
* No webmailer, antivirus or spam protection as I will pull the mails via pop3 into well known big E-Mail providers who know that stuff better.
* Have some frontend to setup mailboxes and aliases.

### Getting set up
TBC
